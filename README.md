# CS2520_project: Flash Card Program (Nebula Flash)

## Overview
This repository contains the code for my flashcard program. This project aims to explore the nuances 
behind the PyQt6 library. A library focused on building graphical user interfaces via Python. By 
combining fundamental princicples behind widgets, layouts and signals I was able to create a basic
flashcard program as not only a project, but as a tool for personal use.
